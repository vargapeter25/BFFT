# Blaschke Fast Fourier Transform and image compression library

A small library implementing Fast Fourier Transform with adaptive base functions, namely rational Blaschke functions.

As an example usage it also implements an image compression technique, where it uses the adaptive bases to try to preserve more details from the image.
